# React components library

This is a personal project that I work on for fun.

I aim to reproduce UI components from game's menus that I love the most.

Check out the [live version](https://www.react-components.jergauth.fr/)!

## Technical

For this project I use the awesome [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) library to help me organize and document my components.

It uses the [Vite builder](https://vitejs.dev/) with [SWC](https://swc.rs/) under the hood.

The live version is hosted on AWS Amplify with my custom domain.
